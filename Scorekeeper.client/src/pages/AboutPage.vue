      This page will eventually explain about the application and give a basic
      glossary of terms used in it. For now, suffice it to say that I created
      this app for my family to use while playing games so that we don't have to
      keep writing down scores on pen and paper and do the math. 😁 It also
      keeps a history of games played.
